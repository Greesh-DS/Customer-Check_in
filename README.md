# Customer-Check_in

Online travel booking for hotel stay which containing the customer details are given in the dataset.

The dataset is trained for making a model using machine learning algorithm to get a better idea of customers checking_in to the hotel from different nationalities.

In this case the Logistic Regression is used as it provides with better accuarcy.






Back propagation is an algorithm used in Artificial intelligence to fine_tune mathematical weight functions and improve the accuracy of an artificial neural network's outputs.
It is an essence of neural net training.
Proper tuning of the weights ensures lower error rates, making the model reliable by increasing its generalization.


If there are null values or missing values in a dataset, it can be handled in manyways:
1. Deleting the rows
2. Repolacing with mean / median / mode
3. Predicting the missing value
